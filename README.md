# European-Carbon-Emission-Forecast
Developed a high-performance, multivariate data pipeline designed to forecast urban carbon emissions across European nations. This project focuses on the intersection of predictive analytics and scalable data architecture, transforming 63 years of longitudinal data into actionable environmental insights.

# 🏙️ Urban Carbon Forecast & Policy Optimizer
**An End-to-End AI and Mathematical Optimization Pipeline**

### 🚀 Overview
This project provides a data-driven framework for urban climate policy. It uses **Deep Learning (LSTM)** to predict carbon emission trends and **Linear Programming (PuLP)** to suggest the most cost-effective budget allocation for carbon reduction.


### 🛠️ Key Features
* **Predictive Intelligence:** A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network trained on 20+ years of European urban data to forecast $CO_2$ per capita.
* **Prescriptive Analytics:** A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) engine that optimizes €500M+ budgets across four critical sectors: Renewables, Transport, Buildings, and Waste.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A Streamlit-based frontend for real-time "What-if" analysis for policymakers.

### 💻 Technical Stack
* **Modeling:** TensorFlow 2.16+, Keras 3, Scikit-Learn
* **Optimization:** PuLP (CBC Solver)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Data Handling:** Pandas (Time-series processing), Joblib (Serialization)

### 📈 Project Impact
The optimizer identified a strategy yielding an **88.00-ton reduction potential** by prioritizing Renewable Energy and Green Buildings within a specific €165M budgetary constraint.
